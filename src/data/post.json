        "question": "Provide a complete review of your firm\u2019s global equity investment methodology and  decision-making process.",
        "answer": "At the highest level, our investment philosophy rests on four principles in support of our overall  goal of providing significant, long-term excess return (\u201calpha\u201d) over appropriate  benchmarks:     - As mentioned earlier, we believe that in order to outperform a  benchmark, a portfolio has to be meaningfully different from that benchmark. In that vein,  we note that our requirement for simple-to-understand, high-quality, consistently-profitable  companies tends to lead us into traditional growth sectors, i.e., technology, health care and  consumer companies. By ending up overweighted to these sectors (where we believe true  growth resides), our portfolios are meaningfully different from the benchmark. This outcome  provides us with significant structural advantages, not the least of which is that increased  wealth and spending around the world will particularly benefit those companies making  technology, providing health care, and creating consumer products.     - We require each prospective company to possess a durable and,  more importantly, improving competitive advantage (in our parlance, an \u201ceconomic  moat\u201d). When valuing a company, historical evidence shows a growing economic moat to  be far more important to that valuation than an absolutely wide economic moat. For that  reason, we spend an enormous amount of our analytical energy determining the  \u201ctrajectory\u201d of a company\u2019s competitive advantage. Importantly, this same concept is  equally valuable when selling holdings. In our work, if a company is no longer growing its  competitive advantage, then it should be sold.     - We believe that successful investing requires an element of gifted ability,  so we strive to foster a firm culture that attracts and keeps gifted investors, including a  commitment to keep the firm simple, and thus relatively small. By extension, our own  commitment to corporate culture means we view all corporate cultures as important to the  long-term success of any enterprise. When evaluating companies, we work on  understanding the \u201cDNA\u201d of the enterprise. In particular, this includes (but is certainly not  limited to) the strength, quality and trustworthiness of management. In our view, a primary  goal of any company should be to attract and retain quality people. Said another way, the  culture is what foundationally enables the success or fosters the failure of a business. We think  this is what separates the great from the merely good.     - Since our objective is to significantly outperform the global indices over  an extended period of time, we employ a focused approach (~35 holdings) to investing.  From one perspective, this reflects our belief that exceptional returns can only be achieved  by structuring a portfolio distinct from the global indices. From another perspective, this  reflects our belief that we have a demonstrable selection edge. Thus, we would rather own  a lot of a good company than a little bit of an average one. Said negatively, we refuse to  dilute the portfolio with inferior ideas.    Underlying these four principles are a couple of important supportive ideas:\nAlso somewhat unusual for so-called \u201cgrowth\u201d managers is our  conviction that long-term outperformance is enhanced by serious consideration of the price  paid for an investment.\nWe start by owning simple-to-understand businesses, with low-or-no debt and relatively  predictable free cash flow generation. We then employ various valuation methods that are  industry- and\/or name-specific.  Some relative measures are useful for broader comparison,  including historical EV\/EBITDA, next year\u2019s P\/E, and a five-year P\/E.  All of this supports our  emphasis on downside protection.   The longer we are in this investment business, the more convinced we  become that temperament is what sets the great investors apart from the pack.  Temperament is that attitude or approach to investing that includes discipline, patience, the  ability to look through the short term to the long term, the ability to \u201cbuy when others are  despondently selling and sell when others are greedily buying,\u201d as Templeton used to say,  and the ability to stay rational when all your emotions are screaming at you to be otherwise.  We think temperament is an oft-overlooked yet important \u201cedge\u201d an investor can have.\nAs stated, we start with simple-to-understand businesses that exhibit clean financials, low-or- no debt, high or rising returns on invested capital, relatively predictable free cash flow  generation, and consistent earnings \/ revenue growth histories. In our analysis, we focus on  each company\u2019s business model (particularly its economic moat), its corporate culture, its  management, and lastly, its valuation (using industry- and\/or name-specific valuation  techniques).\nCurrency hedging is not utilized in this strategy but careful attention is paid to region,  country, and currency exposures.\nWith a minimum time horizon of 3\u20135 years, the portfolio will have lower than average  turnover. The projected annual turnover is 15\u201335%. We expect as much as half the turnover  to be position-size management (trims and adds).\nThe product of our philosophy and process is a focused, all-cap (large-cap biased), quality,  global growth portfolio. We exploit the inefficiencies of broad global indices with a  traditional growth bias, seeking select quality growth businesses from conventional growth  sectors. That, combined with our focused structure, means the portfolio will have investment  characteristics distinct from any broad global benchmark, and will do so with highly liquid  mega-, large- and mid-cap shares from developed and emerging markets.\nIt turns out that the actual number of companies that fit our definition of quality growth is  rather small. Once we disqualify businesses based on hurdles for size, growth, profitability,  financial health, tailwind, moat and culture, there are perhaps 400-450 companies in the  world that meet our criteria. We think we\u2019ve identified the vast majority already, so the real  work is simply maintaining our watch list by adding the occasional new company over time  (due to size, business, and industry developments) and eliminating those that no longer meet  our standards. Since we are also disciplined about valuation, new ideas are often just old  ideas we\u2019ve researched before but have been patiently waiting for a certain price event  before buying.    In defining and narrowing our universe, we utilize the hurdles mentioned. We\u2019ve described  them generally in the answers to philosophy and process; here are some specifics:  Our initial criteria include:    Market cap of greater than $3.5 billion;\nFinancial strength\nA focus on companies offering more predictable growth, which tend to be the  traditional growth sectors. For example, we\u2019re typically not wasting time looking at utilities  or airline stocks.\nThis initial step alone reduces the entire global universe to about 2,100 names. The value-add  here is eliminating businesses for which the valuation effort is a guessing game (not  predictable), which in turn keeps us productively focused on the best opportunities.    Our secondary set of criteria is far more important and adds the most value to the  \u201cnarrowing\u201d process, and to our subsequent returns. They include:    High or rising returns on invested capital. This suggests the presence of an economic  moat.\nLow or no debt. We don\u2019t have a precise standard on this but generally speaking, we  use a net debt\/ EBITDA threshold of about 2.5x\nHigh gross margins; high operating margins.\nHistory of consistent and sustainable growth.\nThis set of hurdles narrows the universe to a very manageable list of 450 names. We believe  all of the top quality growth names are on this list because our stringent criteria identify this  select group. A company with a low single-digit or declining ROIC and excessive debt  cannot be considered quality and would therefore be omitted from the list. Companies that  consistently deliver high or rising ROICs stay on the list so there should be minimal concern  great companies will be missed.    If we just used a computer to \u201cscreen\u201d for investment candidates, it is conceivable (even  likely) that one or several quality companies could be unjustly eliminated at this stage (e.g.,  bad or missing data, too short of a public history, etc.). It is for this very reason we view  computer screens as a useful tool, but just one of many tools for idea generation. We also  find ideas by watching and talking to people we respect, be it investors, managers of  companies, or industry contacts. There\u2019s no single \u201csecret formula\u201d to idea generation and  we\u2019d be very skeptical of any money manager who claims one.    From our narrowed universe of about 450 companies, we are actively following about 225  names for consideration.    There may be different reasons why names remain on this watch list (\u201cFocus List\u201d) yet are not  currently in the portfolio. For example, maybe the company\u2019s valuation may be too  extended, or the company\u2019s culture may have recently endured a struggle, or perhaps we  are wrestling with the growth of a company\u2019s moat.  Our temperament advantage  (discipline and patience) also adds to our overall return by reducing the chance that we  overpay for a great business.\nCriteria we desire for a purchase: The availability of a highly liquid security;\nA market cap of $3.5 billion or greater;\nSimple-to-understand businesses that employ conservative accounting;\nA quality business\u2014which, though often evidenced by clean financials, is, at its root, the  result of an improving competitive advantage;\nCompanies that benefit from long-lasting thematic tailwinds; e.g., the global, emerging  middle class, or the global revolution in information and interconnectedness, etc.;\nDurable and   economic moats (competitive advantages);\nExceptional management teams who have built cultures that complement and sustain  the company\u2019s competitive advantage;\nHigh or rising returns on invested capital;\nConsistent earnings and revenue growth histories;\nA well-capitalized company with strong cash flow;\nLow or no debt.\nSell discipline: If we find a more attractive name in an essentially similar industry;\nIf the company\u2019s moat shows signs of deterioration, or we can no longer make the case  it is expanding;\nIf leadership loses its way or if the culture is challenged;\nTrim discipline: If portfolio weight becomes excessive (typically 5-6%);\nIf the relative valuation is less attractive.\nPortfolio construction begins by identifying businesses that meet our just mentioned purchase  criteria (a simple-to-understand business, superior growth prospects, high or rising returns on  invested capital, low or no debt, a durable and growing economic moat, an appropriate   corporate culture [well-articulated and consistently applied, which includes a capable and  trustworthy management team] and a reasonable valuation).\nRisk control impacts certain other construction aspects. Specifically, at least 15 global  industries will be represented with maximum industry exposure limited to ~15%. Sector  exposure is limited to ~ 35%. Initially, new positions will start from 2% to 5% with maximum  positions sizes of ~10% (in practice, we would most likely begin trimming stocks around 5-6%).  Lastly, emerging markets exposure is capped at ~35% but historically has ranged from  between 10-25%. Notably, our EM exposure is predominantly larger, more established  multinationals in conventional growth sectors, most of which derive a majority of revenue  from developed countries, in contrast to the large natural resource companies that  dominate most EM indexes and manager portfolios.\nLastly, we consider geographical revenue exposures, thematic tailwinds, categories of  economic moats (\u201cmoat typologies\u201d), and growth expectations (i.e., defensive, secular, and  cyclical).    The final result of our process is a high-quality portfolio that is focused, yet holistically  balanced.\nWe produce original equity research that focuses on four main points:\nDuring fundamental analysis of a company\u2019s financials, our analysts rigorously examine  the firm\u2019s business and financial strength, revenues, returns, and accounting policies. We  also focus on the company\u2019s publications, such as an annual report or 20-F.    The single biggest factor in our investment decision is the company\u2019s economic moat.  We spend most of our time studying and analyzing the company\u2019s competitive  advantage, most particularly its evolution, or \u201ctrajectory.\u201d    As noted, this qualitative layer of analysis is extremely important in our process and  pertains to our confidence that a positive moat trajectory can be sustained for several  years. To evaluate the corporate culture, we gather information from quarterly  conference calls, company publications (e.g., annual reports), independent \u201cgrass- roots\u201d research, telephone discussions with the company and, if necessary, company  visits. At this stage we make extensive use of our network of roughly 500,000 industry  executives and experts (this is our Gerson Lehrman Group resource). Once we understand the business model and the moat, we determine the market-price- implied expectations as part of the testing of our assumptions (i.e., what does the market  think about this business? Why do we think it is attractively priced?) We then employ  various valuation methods that are industry- and name-specific. In addition, relative  measures are useful for broader comparison, such as historical EV\/EBITDA, next year\u2019s P\/E,  and a five-year P\/E.  All of this supports our emphasis on downside protection.\nWe are bottom-up fundamental investors. We do not rely on quantitative or economic  analysis in our decisions. But neither do we completely ignore such items, since all of them  they can help in the important process of testing our assumptions, as mentioned above.    WCM\u2019s Quality Global Growth Investment Strategy Group (ISG), consisting of the five  portfolio managers, makes all portfolio decisions. Our process begins with analysis and  qualification of portfolio candidates, identifying great businesses based on positioning (we  avoid businesses fighting \u201cheadwinds\u201d and require a long-lasting \u201ctailwind\u201d), competitive  advantage (we insist on a durable, strengthening economic moat) and corporate culture  (one that values great people and sustains the economic moat). Portfolio construction then  provides a high level of risk control through thoughtful diversification while best capitalizing  on the expected growth of these great businesses. In particular, when contemplating the  inclusion of any specific company into the Quality Global Growth portfolio, the ISG will  consider how that business fits the portfolio from traditional perspectives such as  sector\/industry diversification and country\/currency diversification, but additionally from the  perspectives of tailwinds (e.g., demographics, global commerce, outsourcing, the growing  global middle class, proliferation of technology) and competitive advantage types (e.g.,  economies of scale, switching costs, outsourcing, network effect, legal or regulatory, etc.).  The final portfolio is built with these inputs toward the goal of solid upside participation and  extraordinary downside protection. Decisions are made by simple majority (no member has  veto power). Split decisions result in no action.\nThe long-term, low-turnover nature of our investment process means that trading is not ever  expected to be a significant source of value added. Nevertheless, we recognize how easily  careless trading can subtract value. Therefore, we allocate significant resources to  maintaining and improving our trading operations.    Trading costs are measured on a per trade basis utilizing VWAP as the primary metric. That\u2019s  coupled with a keen appreciation for opportunity costs, which are difficult to quantify using  currently available algorithms.",

        "question": "What is your firm\u2019s competitive advantage? How is this competitive advantage integrated in  your investment process?",
        "answer": "Our firm\u2019s competitive advantage, particularly as it pertains to this Quality Global Growth  portfolio, has three major aspects:\n, we believe the portfolio possesses a significant structural advantage. This derives from  our bottom-up process for identifying great investments, which quite naturally leads us to  emphasize traditional growth sectors (e.g., consumer, technology, health care). A fortuitous  result of this emphasis, especially outside the U.S., is that you not only have a portfolio  materially different than the benchmark, you also have a portfolio that stands to  meaningfully benefit from the global, emerging middle class. That is, as emerging-economy  consumers experience higher disposable incomes, they will do what developed-economy  consumers have done for decades: expand their use of technology, seek out higher quality,  branded consumer goods, and demand more comprehensive health care. That\u2019s why we  believe our portfolio\u2019s structure positions it in front of a multi-decade tailwind\u2014the sources of  real growth will come from the sectors we emphasize, and those sectors will inexorably  become more important and more significant as the developing world matures.\n, and more importantly, we believe our process has a significant stock-selection  advantage. This derives from our framework for identifying successful businesses  (investments). The heart of that framework is our approach to evaluating competitive  advantage. Merely recognizing and classifying a company\u2019s competitive advantage is, of  course, essential, but we believe it far more vital to gauge the growth trajectory of that  advantage. Said another way, it\u2019s important to have a moat, but it\u2019s much more important  to have a moat that\u2019s widening. In financial metrics, one of the ways this manifests is in rising  ROICs. Another is extended and sustainable growth rates. In sum, we think a process that  focuses on sustainable growth with improving ROICs\u2014the hallmarks of a growing economic  moat\u2014will yield far greater returns than alternatives. Further, this approach not only provides  an edge in assessing the true value-creation potential of a business (in both magnitude and  duration), it also affords us a temperamental edge over and against the much shorter-term  mindset of most investors. This, then, is the bottom-up process that leads us to emphasize  predictable, consistently profitable, high-free-cash-flow, low-debt businesses in traditional  growth sectors, as mentioned in point one. , and perhaps most importantly, we believe we have a temperamental advantage,  which goes beyond just the time arbitrage described in point two. This derives from our  efforts to build a culture at WCM that fosters humility, absence of fear, audacious \/ different  thinking, and continuous learning. As we\u2019ve done that, we\u2019ve come to believe that a culture  which attracts and keeps the best people is not only important to the success of our firm, but  that it is important to the success of any organization, and, in particular, to the businesses  (investments) we want to own. Ultimately, it is great people that keep a business squarely in  front of the important \u201ctailwinds\u201d, and it is great people that nurture the competitive  advantage to grow year after year. We think that building these concepts into our culture  and into our process is why our small team has exhibited the judgment and temperament  necessary for long-term success.",

        "answer": "There are a number of environments in which we expect to outperform. Since this strategy is  a true growth strategy for the global universe, the sectors we own (technology, health care  and consumer), will most likely benefit from the increased spending of the \u201cemerging middle  class\u201d around the world. As developing countries create larger middle classes, there are  sound reasons to believe that this newfound wealth will be spent on the items we cherish in  the developed world. We\u2019ll even go so far as to suggest that the global benchmarks will  begin to reflect this increased wealth by evolving from high weightings in financials, basic  materials, industrials and energy (characteristics resembling a \u201cvalue\u201d index) to higher  weightings in technology, health care and consumer names (more like a \u201ccore\u201d index).\nOver somewhat shorter time frames, we also expect to perform well when the world  demands predictability, simplicity and transparency, all of which describe the types of  businesses we own. Outperformance is also likely during a mid-cycle slowdown and\/or a  flight to quality, environments that usually hurt value-oriented sectors such as basic materials,  energy, utilities, and financials.    In general, we may underperform in a market that favors highly leveraged and\/or beaten  down names. Similarly, we may also underperform during a financials, basic materials and\/or  energy boom.",

        "question": "Are sector\/industry allocations determined relative to a designated benchmark? If so, which  one?",
        "answer": "We are very aware of our sector\/industry allocations relative to the broad global  benchmarks, but they are more the result of our philosophy and process than any explicit  top-down decision. Keep in mind the strategy is designed to exploit the inefficiencies of the  global indices with a traditional growth bias, seeking select quality growth businesses from  conventional growth sectors. That, combined with our focused structure, means the product  will have investment characteristics, including industry\/sector allocations, very distinct from  any global benchmark. At the same time, we employ risk controls to ensure the portfolio is  properly constructed. Specifically, at least 15 global industries will be represented with  maximum industry exposure limited to ~15%. Sector exposure is limited to a maximum of  ~35%.    All portfolio construction decisions are made on an absolute basis, not relative to a  benchmark.",

        "question": "Does the global equity product include investments in emerging markets? If so, discuss in  detail, noting any investment guideline limits.",
        "answer": "Yes, we own emerging markets names, but we limit our exposure at ~35% (based on  domicile).     We have not hit that limit since the inception of the portfolio.    That said, classifying stocks as \u201cemerging markets\u201d can be misleading. For example, many of  the companies we own derive much of their revenue from the U.S. Emerging markets scrutiny  is well placed for small, localized, single-currency companies, but not for more established  multinational emerging markets names that may derive substantial revenue from developed  markets.\nAlso, consider the fact that two-thirds of the market capitalization of EM benchmarks is  comprised of natural resources (i.e., basic materials & energy) and financials (i.e., banks).  Our emerging markets exposure is distinct from this exposure.\nThe Great Financial Crisis and bear market of 2008 is a great case-in-point here. Many  managers suffered greatly owning emerging markets names that year. This was in stark  contrast to our emerging markets holdings, several of which were among the best  performers in our entire portfolio for that period.",

        "question": "How do you define risk? How does your firm mitigate portfolio risk?",
        "answer": "Risk, at the most primal level, is the potential for permanent capital loss.  At a secondary  level, risk is volatility of portfolio value, particularly downside volatility. We manage and  attempt to mitigate risk through portfolio construction and individual holdings quality.    We utilize various industry-standard risk measures (e.g., standard deviation, tracking error)  and various reward\/risk ratios (e.g., Sharpe, Treynor, information ratio, etc.) in an attempt to  quantify risk and be conversant with others who analyze our performance. We routinely  employ Brinson attribution analysis (through either FactSet or Bloomberg) to determine  historical performance trends, and we occasionally utilize risk model analysis on Bloomberg\u2019s  Portfolio & Risk Analytics platform, which allows us to conduct scenario analysis, analyze  global risk factors relative to the benchmark and the risk model, and quantify our risk bets  against the risk model. As mentioned above, though, volatility is   a secondary aspect  of risk, particularly for the long-term investor. That\u2019s why we view all of these quantitative risk  tools with some skepticism (not as to their efficacy, but as to their real value).    The Risk Committee consists of the David Brewer (CCO), Monica Bullard (Compliance  Manager), Sloane Payne (COO), Andrew Wiechert (Operations & Risk Manager), Kurt  Winrich (Co-CEO and ISG Member, Global Growth Team), and Drew French (Marketing &  Communications Manager).

In  general, we like to start with a smaller-sized position and \u201cwork into it\u201d over time.\nNormally we do not do a lot of trading. The historical turnover of the portfolio has averaged  about 25%, and roughly half of that is position-size management (trims and adds), driven by  factors like overvaluation, a significant price break, or a company becoming too large of a  position. When we do act, we try to do so in a meaningful way to ensure we have conviction  in the decision.",

        "question": "Do you trade all accounts to a model portfolio? Describe the standard trading process,  including systems utilized to optimize risk control.",
        "answer": "Yes, all accounts are traded to a model portfolio. All buy and sell decisions are made by the  Investment Strategy Group. The ISG builds and maintains the model portfolio for the strategy.  Barring any client-imposed restrictions, all accounts are traded to the same model.     Operational optimization or risk control techniques are comprised of process and systems. A  key component is our portfolio management system from INDATA  (\u201cIMS\u201d). It combines  portfolio accounting, trading and performance calculation in one structure and allows  automation to be incorporated within various operations (e.g., trading, reconciliation,  performance, pre- and post-trade compliance checks, etc.).     Our process utilizes the system in the following manner:     Once a trade decision is made, a model is created on IMS. Using optimization tools in  IMS, the Portfolio Management Team, comprised of a Portfolio Manager and a Portfolio  Associate, works with the Trader to compare the model against all accounts using the  strategy. Portfolios are then shaped (modeled) using a combination of system automation  and manual review. Trades are created and allocated. During the trade creation process,  the system conducts a compliance check.      IMS accommodates all quantifiable client guidelines, including but not limited to asset  allocation guidelines, security restrictions (e.g., SRI), transaction restrictions (e.g., general buy,  sale, short sale, etc.), tax lot sale guidelines (e.g., FIFO, LIFO, high cost, etc.), realized  gain\/loss restrictions (e.g., long-term, specific year, etc.). Pre-trade compliance checks for  most guidelines are integrated into our trading system (e.g., security restrictions, general  buy\/sell restrictions, etc.). Others are monitored with add-on utilities that analyze portfolio  system data and generate periodic reports for portfolio managers (e.g., sector exposure  guidelines, etc.). Some are monitored both ways (e.g., asset allocation guidelines).  Trades are pre-allocated and routed within IMS to the WCM Trade Blotter. The Trader  executes the trades based on the instructions from the ISG. In accordance with WCM\u2019s  Trade Rotation Policy, trades are sent to brokers using a FIX connection. Trade executions are  sent back via the same FIX connection and automatically logged in IMS. Trade allocations  and settlement instructions are sent to the broker. On T+1, trades are matched and  confirmed in IMS with DTC. For DVP trading, trade information is sent to the custodian for  settlement. Trades are monitored by the Trade Settlement Team until properly settled on  Settlement Date. Daily, the Recon Group reconciles all trade activity using electronic data  feeds from custodians and works with the Trade Settlement Team should any issues arise.\nIMS also conducts post-trade compliance reviews to ensure proper adherence to client  investment guidelines and restrictions. Weekly reports are sent to portfolio managers, the  Leadership Team, and the CCO. Monthly, the Operations and Risk Manager conducts a drift  audit of all portfolios against their relevant models. Finally, all trade activity is reviewed by the  Best Execution Committee and tested by the Compliance Team to ensure all policies and  procedures have been followed.",

        "question": "Discuss security trade rotation policies and procedures connected with the execution of  investment decisions for your firm",
        "answer": "The purpose of the Trade Rotation Policy and Procedures is to ensure that no client or  account is consistently disadvantaged over another within the trading parameters  established by the client and to avoid competition in the markets among orders between  clients or accounts. It applies when trading strategy-wide programs that aggregate or  \u201cblock\u201d accounts for execution. As noted above, WCM generally aggregates orders being  placed for execution at the same time for the accounts of two or more clients where it  believes such aggregation is appropriate and in the best interest of its clients.   Trade Order Rotation is subject to Best Execution. In order to obtain best execution, due to  the timing of international markets and the liquidity available in those markets, portfolios with  ordinary shares are often traded before other portfolios containing ADRs. All trade activity is  reviewed by the Best Execution Committee to ensure best execution.  a. Accounts are divided into two buckets:\n1) Bucket A consists of all accounts over which WCM has full discretion for  trade execution and settlement (\u201cNon-Directed Brokerage Clients\u201d).  These accounts generally have the following characteristics:  i. the client\u2019s custodian does not provide bundled brokerage  services;  ii. the client\u2019s custodian does not charge \u201ctrade away\u201d fees;  iii. the client has not provided directed-brokerage instructions to  WCM for currency or securities trades; and  iv. the client is not participating in a Wrap Fee Program or UMA  Program.\n2) Bucket B consists of all other accounts, including:  i. those for which the client has provided explicit directed-brokerage  instructions to WCM;  ii. accounts whose custodian provides bundled brokerage services  and may charge \u201ctrade away\u201d fees (e.g., Charles Schwab,  Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, etc.);  iii. accounts participating in Wrap Fee Programs or UMA Programs;  iv. accounts with non-standard trade or settlement systems\/processes  (or systems\/processes that are otherwise incompatible with WCM\u2019s  trade systems\/processes,) and;  v. accounts with Client-imposed restrictions or certain other  specialized requirements.  b. Within each bucket, accounts are blocked based on the order aggregation  procedures note above.  c. Accounts in Bucket A will typically trade first, followed by accounts in Bucket\nB, so that Non-Directed Brokerage Clients are not disadvantaged as a result  of the specialized requirements of the other clients. Under normal  circumstances, trading for accounts in Bucket B will not start until trading for  accounts in Bucket A is complete.  d. Upon completion of trading for accounts in Bucket A, trades for accounts in\nBucket B will be entered on a straight rotational basis (i.e., the accounts at the  end of the last trade program move to the beginning of the next trade  program,) a procedure that is designed to ensure that no one client, or group  of clients, within this Bucket has an unfair advantage over another client, or  group of clients, within this Bucket.  e. Trade Order Rotation records are recorded in the Trade Blotter. It is reviewed  by the Best Execution Committee.\nMore information about WCM\u2019s trade rotation policies and procedures can be found in our  Form ADV Part 2A (http:\/\/www.wcminvest.com\/publications), and in our Compliance  Manual, which is available upon request.",

        "question": "Discuss security trading aggregation practices connected with the execution of investment  decisions for your firm",
        "answer": "WCM generally aggregates or \u201cblocks\u201d orders being placed for execution at the same time  for the accounts of two or more Clients where it believes such aggregation is appropriate  and in the best interest of Clients. This practice may enable WCM to seek more favorable  executions and net prices for the combined order. Trades for WCM personnel are  aggregated with Client trades as permitted by the Code of Ethics.     All block orders are subject to WCM\u2019s order aggregation and allocation policy and  procedures (\u201cProcedures\u201d). The Procedures are designed to meet applicable legal  standards. They have been designed to ensure that no Client or account will be favored  over another. WCM makes decisions to recommend, purchase, sell or hold securities for all of  its Client accounts, including affiliated Client accounts, based on the specific investment  objectives, guidelines, restrictions and circumstances of each account.     WCM believes that aggregating orders will, in general, benefit its Clients as a whole over  time by lowering the commissions for the aggregate transaction. Aggregation typically  benefits the accounts because of the much larger volume discount obtainable with the  aggregate transaction than that possible with the single account. However, in any particular  instance, aggregation may result in a less favorable price or execution for any particular  Client than might have been obtained if a particular transaction had been effected  separately. In addition, Clients that have individually negotiated commission rates with their  desired broker-dealer may pay a higher commission than others in a block order when their  broker-dealer executes a transaction.     When it is favorable to the Client, WCM aggregates transactions for wrap fee accounts  executed through Sponsors with transactions for fully discretionary accounts either on a  straight rotation basis, meaning that wrap accounts are executed in any order alongside  fully discretionary accounts. In other cases, WCM causes transactions for wrap fee accounts  to wait behind fully discretionary, non-directed accounts because of the inherent delays  and related issues caused by the wrap accounts\u2019 directed brokerage to particular Sponsors.\nIn order to obtain best execution, due to the timing of international markets and the liquidity  available in those markets, portfolios with ORDs are typically traded before other portfolios  containing ADRs.\nAll trade activity is reviewed by the Best Execution Committee to ensure best execution.
